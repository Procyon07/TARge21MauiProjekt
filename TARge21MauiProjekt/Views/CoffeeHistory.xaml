One of the most famous of these attributes its honour to the man called Kaldi from the region of Caffa from Ethiopia. Kaldi was trying to put his goats to sleep for so long time. The goats had been chewing the shiny leaves and red berries growing on the branches of the coffee tree. The goat herd also tasted the berries and soon became just as bright. Some of the berries, however, he threw away into the fire, which gave off a delicious aroma. Someone later suggested a strong flavour to soften the taste the idea of crushing the berries and mixing them with hot water. And so the coffee drink was born." />

The Arab woman had only one way to divorce her husband - if he did not have enough coffee to offer her. The Arabs were the first to use the word 'qahva', from which the Turkish coined their own word for 'coffee' and later, when it reached the Netherlands, it became 'koffie'." />
